# OpenDDS

Examples of OpenDDS integrations with other languages such as python.

The examples are tested in Ubuntu 24.04.

Some code is not yet in the repo, so you cannot build the opendds API libraries and applications (yet).
(This will be included later)

The code is only added to show that you can use OpenDDS's features in python for distributed systems.
